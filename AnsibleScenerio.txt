Ansible Scenario

Description:
There are multiple Linux systems that need to be configured in a single Ansible playbook. One group containing 3 servers is located in the Texas site. Another group of 3 servers is located in the North Carolina site. The servers in North Carolina are running Redhat Enterprise Linux 8 and the Texas servers are running Ubuntu 20.04. All servers are reachable by the Ansible server. 

Inventory:
You have been given the following Ansible inventory file. The inventory file can be modified if needed.

all:
  children:
    NC01:
      hosts:
        nc01:
          ansible_host=192.0.2.52
        nc02:
          ansible_host=192.0.2.53
        nc03:
          ansible_host=192.0.2.54
    TX01:
      hosts:
        tx01:
          ansible_host=192.0.3.52
        tx02:
          ansible_host=192.0.3.53
        tx03:
          ansible_host=192.0.3.54
Configuration Automation:
The following configuration needs to be applied to all of the Linux hosts by the Ansible playbook:
1.	Systems should be fully updated.
2.	On the ubuntu systems install tree, docker, and ansible. On the redhat systems install podman, mariadb, and nginx.
3.	NTP should be fully configured with the site specific configuration below.
4.	Once all of the NTP configuration changes have been made the NTP service needs to be restarted.
5.	Add the host to the CMDB via API:
a.	The API call should be sent to https://192.0.1.100 via a POST
b.	The body must be sent in JSON format.
c.	The body must contain the following JSON structure, the elements in <> should be replaced with the host’s unique values:
{  
          "SystemGroupName":"<sitename>", 
   "SystemHostName":”<hostname>”,
   "SystemOS":"<OS name>",
   “CreationDate”:“<today’s date>”,
   “SystemIPAddress: “<IP address>”
       }
d.	Success if status of 201 is received.
e.	Failure if the output of the API request does not contain the message “System successfully added.”
6.	Print the results of the API request.

Site Specific Configuration:
The following configuration should be applied to the Linux hosts in each respective site:
North Carolina:
1.	These hosts are running ssh on port 2222.
2.	NTP server is 192.0.2.252
3.	Configure NTP with appropriate time zone for the location.
4.	SItename is NC01
Texas:
1.	These hosts are running ssh on port 22.
2.	NTP server is 192.0.3.252
3.	Configure NTP with appropriate time zone for the location.
4.	SItename is TX01

Results:
Please provide your Ansible playbook, the inventory file you would use if modified from above, and any other additional files needed by your playbook.
